			<p> "We contracted them for our baby's christening 
			photo and video shoot as well as our celebration. We were absolutely blown away by their commitment and passion for their work.
			We thought we would have videos and photos from them but I cannot say we 
			received these because when we were presented the portfolio from our shoot
			we were in tears of joy because the videos and photos were more like an artists impression."    -Christine Gonzales
